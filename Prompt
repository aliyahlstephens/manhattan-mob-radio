Can you write a code mostly based in python, html and css for a record label's radio station 
on a website called "Manhattan Mob Records Radio" that plays music randomly from a database 
of wav files called "mobdatabase"? Can you use the logo attached, as well as the colors from
 the logo to influence the website's theme?
